Todo:
- Add screentext pipeline to Aware Narrator project and update its README.md

2025-07-15
- Update config.yaml
    - Added merge_distance_threshold to set up threshold to merge home candidates during clustering. 
    - Added input method to system_ui_apps:
        -  com.google.android.inputmethod.latin         # Gboard
- Updated aware_narrator
    - Clean up code
        - Remove count variable for app usage processing to keep only revisit_count
        - Update comments related to home merge threshold
    - Loading merge_distance_threshold from config.yaml.
    - Fallback to simple app sequences based on foreground app records when session data is avaliable but emtpy app sequence.
    - Update location clustering labels
        - Different unknown places are assigned to unique labels (e.g., unknown1, unknown2)


2025-07-14
- Updated aware_narrator
    - Improved system UI and blacklist filtering based on package name
    - Fixed system UI filtering bugs
    - Implemented centralied System UI filtering for application sensors: foreground, notification, and installation
    - Implemented System UI filtering for screentext sensors
    - Keyboard sensor does not apply system UI filering to avoid data loss (e.g., keyboard apps)

- Manual setup:
    - Check updates on the github repo https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python.git
    - Replace your local geocoding.py by finding the path
        -E.g.,  /home/ubuntu/miniforge3/envs/student/lib/python3.13/site-packages/googlemaps/geocoding.py by the latest script from the repo
    - https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python/blob/master/googlemaps/geocoding.py
- Updated aware_narrator.py
    - Location: 
        - Includec days without nighttime points
        - Implement address descriptors
        - Better readability
        - Filter out a visited place with 2 thresholds
            - Minimum data points:
                - Loaded from location_minimum_data_points in config.yaml 
                    - E.g., at least 3 points to display a place in location description
            - Minimum stay duration:
                - Loaded from location_minimum_stay_minutes in config.yaml
                    - E.g., at least to stay 5 minutes to display a place in location description
        - Merged visit count, perioud, and sequence after fitering.
    - Bluetooth and WIFI
        - To show up to 10 most frequency detected named devices

- Added screen text preprocess pipeline
- Added geocoding.py for manual setup

- Updated README.md and config.yaml
